### [Pronouns, possession, negation](https://Prayuja-Teli.github.io/Blog/negation)<br/>

Pronouns are used in place of a noun we already know, so we do not have to repeat names.<br/>

### Subject,Object,Reflexive
<br/>Subject: Subjective pronouns are the simplest form of the pronoun, used to replace the name of a subject, instead of repeating a noun.<br/>
They are I, you, he, she, it, we, they, He.<br/>
<br/>Object: When a pronoun is used in place of a noun that is the object of a sentence, we use the object form of pronouns. <br/>These are me, you, him, her, it, us, them, him.<br/>
<br/>Reflexive: Reflexive pronouns are used in special cases where the subject and object are the same, to demonstrate that an action is being done by the subject to the subject.<br/>
<br/>Eg: to wash yourself. These pronouns replace the object and are: myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, themselves,himself.<br/>

### My vs Mine <br/>
my is a possessive adjective and mine is a possessive pronoun.So, this means you use my where you already have a noun (such as question) and want to indicate ownership.
<br/>Like with all pronouns, you use mine in place of another noun when it's understood what's being discussed.<br/><br/>
Mine question is ungrammatical because it incorrectly uses two nouns (mine and question) as the subject of a sentence.You use either a noun or a pronoun, never both at the same time.<br/>
Use a noun (my question) if the topic is just being introduced, or a pronoun (mine) if the reader or listener will already know you are talking about (they will know you are talking about your question).<br/>
The following are correct examples:<br/>
1. My question is something uses my to indicate whose question is being described.<br/>
That question is mine uses mine to refer back to the subject (that question) and add information describing whose it is.<br/>
2. Mine is something describes some object of yours (e.g. your question) which was previously named and is currently the topic of conversation.<br/>

### This or that : these or those<br/>
We use:<br/>
this and that in the singular,<br/>
these and those in the Plural.<br/>
Generally speaking, we use this/these to refer to people and things, situations and experiences that are close to the speaker or very close in time. <br/>
We use that/those to refer to people and things, situations and experiences that are more distant, either in time or physically.<br/>
1. This is a great game. (We are watching the game.)<br/>
2. That was a great game. (The game is over.)<br/>
one/ones<br/>
We use one/ones instead of repeating a countable noun.<br/>

### Singular,Plural<br/>
Singular: one<br/>
Plural: ones<br/>
1. John has three cars – a red car and two blue cars.<br/>
2. John has three cars – a red one and two blue ones.<br/>

### Every vs all<br/>
All and every can both be used to talk about people or things in general. There is little difference in meaning.<br/>
 
Every is used with singular countable nouns. To give the same meaning, all is used with plural nouns.<br/>
All can be used with determiners. Every cannot normally be used with them.<br/>
1. The questionnaire was sent to all employees.<br/>
2. The questionnaire was sent to every employee.<br/>

### Quantifiers with of and the<br/>
Quantifiers are a type of determiner which denote imprecise quantity.<br/>
They modify nouns or pronouns.<br/>
They differ from numbers or numerals which indicate precise quantity.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>
