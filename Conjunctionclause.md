### Conjunction<br/>

A conjunction is the glue that holds words, phrases and clauses (both dependent and independent) together. There are three different kinds of conjunctions -- coordinating, subordinating, and correlative -- each serving its own, distinct purpose, but all working to bring words together.<br/>
Conjunctions are words that link other words, phrases, or clauses together.<br/>

Example:<br/>

I like cooking and eating, but I donâ€™t like washing dishes afterward. Sophie is clearly exhausted, yet she insists on dancing till dawn.<br/>
Conjunctions allow you to form complex, elegant sentences and avoid the choppiness of multiple short sentences. Make sure that the phrases joined by conjunctions are parallel (share the same structure).<br/>

Corrent: I work quickly and careful.<br/>
Incorrect: I work quickly and carefully.<br/>

### Clause:<br/>

A unit of grammatical organization next below the sentence in rank and in traditional grammar said to consist of a subject and predicate.<br/>

Example:<br/>
1. He must stop laughing. - Standard declarative <br/>
2. Should he stop laughing? - Yes/no-question expressed <br/><br/><br/><br/>
