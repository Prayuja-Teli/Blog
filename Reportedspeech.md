### What is reported speech?<br/>

Reported speech is when you tell somebody else what you or a person said before.<br/>
If we report what another person has said, we usually do not use the speaker’s exact words (direct speech), but reported (indirect) speech. Therefore, you need to learn how to transform direct speech into reported speech. The structure is a little different depending on whether you want to transform a statement, question or request.<br/>

### How it works?<br/>

We use a 'reporting verb' like 'say' or 'tell'.If this verb is in the present tense, it's easy. We just put 'she says' and then the sentence:<br/>

Direct speech: I like ice cream.<br/>
Reported speech: She says (that) she likes ice cream.<br/>

Examples:<br/>
direct speech : 	“I speak English.”<br/>
reported speech: 	He says that he speaks English.<br/>
reported speech:	He said that he spoke English.<br/>

Do you have to backshift the tenses?<br/>
Do you have to change expressions of time and place?<br/>

### Indirect Speech<br/>
Reported or indirect speech is usually used to talk about the past, so we normally change the tense of the words spoken. We use reporting verbs like 'say', 'tell', 'ask', and we may use the word 'that' to introduce the reported words. Inverted commas are not used.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
