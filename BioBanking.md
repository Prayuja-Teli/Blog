As we all know nowadays, Biobanks are spreading rigorously.Many diseases didn't have any cure before 10 years. If you look in statistics multiple amounts of patients are saved due to a cure on rare diseases like cancer.<br/>

#### How do Biobanks handle large datasets?<br/>

#### Ans: 
LIMS â€“ Laboratory Information Management System<br/>

#### Explanation: 

LIMS software manages test samples and tracks the performance end to end.LIMS can trace sample origins, their storage location, and the change in custody when accessed by different members of the laboratory. <br/>
As this software improve a lot below are a few suggested points.<br/>
1. Manage complex biographical information of each sample donor.<br/>
2. Maintain a centralized system that controls data extraction from several sources and documents.<br/>
3. Sharing of sample information with security to researchers located at different geographic locations.<br/>
4. Enabling longitudinal studies such as disease monitoring, aging studies, and biomarker discovery depending on the specific demographic population.<br/>
