[File Management](https://Prayuja-Teli.github.io/Blog/FileManagment)

All data in Unix is organized into files. All files are organized into directories. These directories are organized into a tree-like structure called the filesystem.<br/>

In Unix, there are three basic types of files −<br/>

Ordinary Files − An ordinary file is a file on the system that contains data, text, or program instructions.<br/>

Directories − Directories store both special and ordinary files. For users familiar with Windows or Mac OS, Unix directories are equivalent to folders.<br/>

Special Files − Some special files provide access to hardware such as hard drives, CD-ROM drives, modems, and Ethernet adapters.<br/>

### File System Permissions <br/>


Because Linux is a multiuser system, every file in a Linux file system belongs to a user and a group. <br/>
Only the owner of a file or directory can grant other users access permission to it.<br/>
Linux basically distinguishes between three different types of access permissions: write permission, read permission and execute permission.<br/>

There are several ways to change the access permissions of files and folders: either traditionally via the shell or with the help of your desktop's file manager.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
