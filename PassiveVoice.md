[Passive Voice](https://Prayuja-Teli.github.io/Blog/PassiveVoice)

### Definition<br/>
The passive voice is used when we want to emphasize the action (the verb) and the object of a sentence rather than subject.<br/>

Eg: <br/>

Active Voice-
Harry ate six shrimp at dinner.<br/>
Passive Voice-
At dinner, six shrimp were eaten by Harry.<br/>

### Distinction between passive voice and participial adjective<br/>

A distinction is made between the above type of clause and a superficially similar construction where a word with the form of a past participle is used as predicative adjective, and the verb be or similar is simply a copula linking the subject of the sentence to that adjective.<br/>

### Reasons for using the passive voice

Three stores were robbed last night.<br/>
A new cancer drug has been discovered.<br/>
Mistakes have been made on this project.<br/><br/><br/>
