### [Word Order in english](https://Prayuja-Teli.github.io/Blog/WordOrder)<br/>

Most English sentences (clauses) conform to the SVO word order. <br/>
This means that the Subject comes before the Verb, which comes before the Object.<br/> 

The sentence<br/>
The word order in sentences is: Subject – Verb (Predicate) – Object.<br/>
Examples:<br/><br/>
| Subject | Verb | Object |
| :------------- | :------------- |  :------------- |
| I  | play | 	football |
| Max	| reads|	books.
| We |	can speak |	English.
| Sue	|is singing|	a nice song.|
| I | bought | a new computer |
| She | doesn't like | dogs |
| Why |did you | do | that? |


<br/><br/>
ATTENTION!<br/>
Do not split the verb forms in English. The following sentence is wrong: I can English speak.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
