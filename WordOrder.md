### [Word Order in english](https://Prayuja-Teli.github.io/Blog/WordOrder)<br/>

Most English sentences (clauses) conform to the SVO word order. <br/>
This means that the Subject comes before the Verb, which comes before the Object.<br/> 

The sentence<br/>
The word order in sentences is: Subject – Verb (Predicate) – Object.<br/><br/>
Examples:<br/>

 I (S)   play  (V)	football (O)<br/>
 Max	(S)  reads(V)	books.(O)<br/>
 We (S) 	can speak (V)	English.(O)<br/>
 Sue(S) is singing	(V)a nice song.(O)<br/>
 I (S)  bought  a (V)new computer (O)<br/>
 She (S)  doesn't like (V)  dogs (O)<br/>
 Why (S) did you (V) do  that? (O)<br/>
<br/>
ATTENTION!<br/>
Do not split the verb forms in English. The following sentence is wrong: I can English speak.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
