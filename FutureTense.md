## [Future Tense](https://Prayuja-Teli.github.io/Blog/FutureTense)<br/>

### Definition: <br/>
The future tense is used to talk about actions happening in the future.<br/>
Something which will happen or done later on.<br/>
Eg: I will write a book<br/>

### Types of future tenses:<br/>

### 1. Simple Future: <br/>
Talk about something (like action or event) that will happen any time in the future, and also to talk about something that will happen one time. <br/>
Eg: I will eat a cheeseburger for dinner.<br/>

### 2. Future Continuous: <br/>
The future continuous tense talk about things will be happening continuously in the future.<br/>
Eg: Jane will be driving to work.<br/>

### 3. Future Perfect: <br/>
The future perfect tense shows that an event will have happened before another thing in the future. It often expresses that by the time one action or event happens, another will have happened. To use the future perfectly, we need to place the modal will and the auxiliary have before the past form of the main verb (this shows that we “will have done” an action).<br/>
Eg: Jane will have traveled the world by the time she turns 30.<br/>

### 4. Future Perfect Continuous: <br/>
The future perfect continuous describes events and/or actions that have been going on continuously until a certain time in the future. Often, it’s used to show cause and effect; in other words, because one thing will have been happening, another will happen. To use it, we need to combine have and be with the continuous form of the verb (ending in ing), this shows that the action or event “will have been” happening.<br/>
Eg: I should have been watering the plants every day; I hope they won’t die.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
