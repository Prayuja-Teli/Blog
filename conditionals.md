### Conditional Sentence<br/>

Conditional Sentences are also known as Conditional Clauses or If Clauses. They are used to express that the action in the main clause (without if) can only take place if a certain condition (in the clause with if) is fulfilled. There are three types of Conditional Sentences.<br/>

Conditional sentences have two parts: the if-clause and the main clause.<br/>

Example sentence: If it rains, I will cancel the trip.<br/>

If it rains is the if-clause and I will cancel the trip is the main clause.<br/>

The IF-clause introduces a condition. The main clause is the result of that condition.<br/>

### Types<br/>

1. The Zero Conditional: <br/>
(if + present simple, ... present simple)<br/>
If you heat water t<br/>o 100 degrees, it boils.
2. The First Conditional:<br/>

3. The Second Conditional:<br/>

If I had a lot of money, I would travel around the world.<br/>
4. The Third Conditional: <br/>
