### Biobank: <br/>

A person who has an average knowledge of biobank will think that biobank is something that store bio samples that's it.
But In addition to being a collection of biosamples, a biobank is a collection of logistical protocols, consulting services, and data structures. Biobanking’s growth took place over the decades and still exploring its boundaries.<br/>

###  Cold storage plus hot tips<br/>
Cold storage plus hot tips was founded in 1953 in New Jersey. It is the nonprofit Coriell Institute which has been storing tissues for decades longer than the term “biobanking” has existed. It represents how Biobank stores different type of samples.Coriell provides different custom storage and preparation of samples and has developed consulting expertise in drafting study protocols and obtaining informed consent.<br/>

### The line between order and disorder<br/>
(How researchers have to focus on small entities?)<br/>
The line between order and disorder founded in 2010 and based in Lund, Sweden.Birka BioStorage focuses on the logistical side of biobanking—the storage, documentation, and disposal of samples for a global clientele of startup and midsized companies.Back in time they don’t even had their own laboratories.Logistics issues remain even for those companies that implement [virtual business models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_business_model).  <br/>


###  Ensuring reproducibility of scientific work<br/>
Biobank is itself an industry.Variations in reagents and biological substrates that are unaccounted for by researchers because provenance information goes unrecorded. Make sure whatever is processed /stored/collected is documented. Litton says:“People were collecting samples, but they were also [sloppy](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/sloppy)”. He states that every sample is how important and biobanks should maintain them.<br/>

###  FinnGen<br/>
FinnGen is more of a biobanking research project than an actual biobank, it does make use of a network of 10 biobanks in the country, including those at university hospitals, according to FinnGen’s scientific director, Aarno Palotie, MD, PhD.FinnGen collects personal genomic and other data on Finns in a manner similar to that used by the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s All of Us Research Program.This is a research project funded by the Finnish Innovation Fund.
