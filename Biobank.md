### Biobank:</br>

A person who has an average knowledge of biobank will think that biobank is something that store bio samples that's it.
But In addition to being a collection of biosamples, a biobank is a collection of logistical protocols, consulting services, and data structures. Biobanking’s growth took place over the decades and still exploring its boundaries.</br>
