### Articles are words that define a noun as specific or unspecific.<br/>

A: A is used before a singular noun beginning with a consonant sound.<br/>
 Eg:My daughter really wants a dog for Christmas<br/>

An: An is used before a singular noun beginning with a vowel sound.<br/>
 Eg:  I saw an accident this morning outside my house.<br/>

The: The is used before a singular or plural noun.<br/>
Eg:You can use ‘the’ to make general things specific. You can use ‘the’ with any type of noun – plural or singular, countable or uncountable.<br/>

“Please pass me a pen” – any pen.<br/>
“Please pass me the pen” – the one that we can both see.<br/>



### Count nouns<br/>
Refers to items that can be counted and are either singular or plural<br/>
When you have a single, countable English noun, you must always have an article before it. We cannot say “please pass me pen”, we must say “please pass me the pen” or “please pass me a pen” or “please pass me your pen”.<br/>
 
### Non-count nouns<br/>
Refers to items that are not counted and are always singular.<br/>
Uncountable nouns don’t use ‘a’ or ‘an’. This is because you can’t count them. For example, advice is an uncountable noun. You can’t say “he gave me an advice”, but you can say “he gave me some advice”, or “he gave me a piece of advice”.<br/>
