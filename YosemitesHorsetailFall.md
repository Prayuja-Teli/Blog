An ephemeral or temporary waterfall only flows at certain times, and usually not for long. (“Ephemeral” means “lasting a very short time.”)<br/>

This type of waterfall may last for a few hours after a heavy rainstorm or a few weeks due to seasonal runoff. It appears in winter and early spring.<br/>
Horsetail Fall becomes even more spectacular on clear days in mid- to late February, when the setting sun hits it just right and briefly turns it into a glowing orange “Firefall.”<br/>
Bizarrely, Yosemite Park used to actually create “firefalls” by pushing huge piles of coals off the edge of a cliff. These were an incredibly popular tourist sight from the 1880s all the way through the 1960s when the park realized this was a fire hazard (which seems kind of obvious) and stopped. Firefall aside, Horsetail Fall is the second highest free-falling waterfall in Yosemite Valley.<br/>
