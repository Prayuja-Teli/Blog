### History<br/>

Yosemite Park used to actually create “firefalls” by pushing huge piles of coals off the edge of a cliff. These were an incredibly popular tourist sight from the 1880s all the way through the 1960s when the park realized this was a fire hazard and stopped. Firefall aside, Horsetail Fall is the second highest free-falling waterfall in Yosemite Valley.<br/>

### Appearance<br/>
Horsetail Fall appears in winter and early spring.<br/>
An ephemeral or temporary waterfall only flows at certain times, and usually not for long. (“Ephemeral” means “lasting a very short time.”)<br/>
The waterfall last for a few hours after a heavy rainstorm or a few weeks due to seasonal runoff.<br/>
Horsetail Fall becomes even more spectacular on clear days in mid- to late February, when the setting sun hits it just right and briefly turns it into a glowing orange “Firefall.”<br/>
